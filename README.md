# HackerNews Redesigned with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React -- a One Day Project
My main inspiration for this project was the official [HackerNews website](https://news.ycombinator.com) and the [HackerNews Redesign](https://hn-redesign.vercel.app) made by [Rocktim](https://github.com/rocktimsaikia/hackernews-redesign). 

## To Do
* Use the official HackerNews API instead of placeholder JSON data.
* Use Infinite Scroll. 
* Add Ask, Jobs, and Show pages.
